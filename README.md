# Insights from Unstructured Data

## Creating a pipeline using AWS Textract to extract tables from PDFs

A culinary consulting company has been training school nutrition staff and administrators in the public schools of Oklahoma for several years now. The trainers recorded pre- and post-assessment data and stored it in PDFs and stored multiple years with roughly 12â€“20 different schools each year. They would like some insights into this data. There are 4 specific tables that they would like to be able to glean insights from that appear in each of these several dozen documents.

I used AWS Textract, which is a machine learning tool that can extract data, while maintaining table structures. I used AWS Step Functions to establish the pipeline flow of the ETL process, Python Lambda functions to do the transformations, S3 as my data lake, and Tableau for visualizations.
