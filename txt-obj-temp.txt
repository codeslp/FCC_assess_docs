Line: Menu Analysis for Availability of Freshly Prepared Foods

Line: being prepared.
Line: For each day of the cycle and for each entrée ask the kitchen manager or CND to describe the preparation
Line: method using one of the 4 definitions. Please provide an explanation if a day is left incomplete.
Line: Definitions of preparation methods:
Line: Convenience means the foods are fully processed and only require heating and serving. Examples include heat-
Line: in-serve macaroni and cheese and premade bean and cheese burrito.
Line: Minimal preparation means assembly of ingredients that are highly processed. Examples include premade
Line: meatloaf with rehydrated mashed potatoes and chili dogs make with hot dogs and school made-chili.
Line: Fast scratch means some of the ingredients are raw and some mixing, cooking and preparation is involved. An
Line: example is chicken teriyaki made with precooked and sauced chicken strips, fresh rice and fresh vegetables.
Line: Made from scratch means the ingredients are raw or close-to-raw, including unseasoned, pre-cooked meat. An
Line: example is chicken fajitas made with grilled chicken strips, tortillas and fresh vegetables.
Line: For each of the preparation methods record the corresponding number:
